abstract = {We present the design and noise performance of a fully cryogenic (T=4 K) HEMT-based charge amplifier for readout of massive semiconductor dark matter detectors operating at sub-Kelvin temperatures. The amplifier has been developed to allow direct detection experiments such as CDMS and EDELWEISS to probe WIMP masses below 10 GeV/{\$}c{\^{}}2{\$} while retaining electromagnetic background discrimination. The amplifier dissipates only 1 mW of power and has a measured noise performance three times better than traditional JFET-based charge amplifiers. The predicted ionization energy resolution using the measured intrinsic amplifier noises and typical detector characteristics is {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}E \backslashapprox 100 \backslash,\backslashtext{\{}eV{\}}{\_}{\{}ee{\}}{\$} (33 electrons). We have measured a calibrated baseline energy resolution of {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}E = 91\backslash,\backslashtext{\{}eV{\}}{\_}{\{}ee{\}}{\$} when coupled to a live CDMS-II detector.

abstract = {The author considers the possibility that there is not, in fact, much hidden mass in galaxies and galaxy systems. If a certain modified version of the Newtonian dynamics is used to describe the motion of bodies in a gravitational field (of a galaxy, say), the observational results are reproduced with no need to assume hidden mass in appreciable quantities. Various characteristics of galaxies result with no further assumptions. The basis of the modification is the assumption that in the limit of small acceleration a very low a0, the acceleration of a particle at distance r from a mass M satisfies approximately a2/a0 ≈ MGr-2, where a0 is a constant of the dimensions of an acceleration.},

abstract = {The read-out electronics of the EDELWEISS-II experiment is presented. Its implementation has been guided by two important design choices. The first one is putting cold electronics far from the detectors in order to attenuate possible background sources from electronic components. It implies strong constraints on noise optimization, line stray capacitance and thermal load. The second one is acquisition of fully digitized signals to minimize the E.M. noises and to take full advantage of digital processing possibilities for filtering and triggering. The resulting amplification scheme is presented for both ionization and heat channel, as well as performances of the full read-out scheme. Future prospects about the coming EDELWEISS-III experiment electronics are also discussed. This updated design takes advantage of the experience gained in previous steps of the experiment while aiming at fulfilling specific constraints of a future ton-scale experiment.},

An anisotropy of the drift velocity and of the diffusion coefficient is found with the electric field applied along 〈111〉 and 〈100〉 directions, the latter due to the intervalley diffusion. The effect of the electron-electron interaction in the anisotropy properties has also been investigated. Theoretical Monte Carlo calculations have been performed with a model which includes lower, 〈111〉, nonparabolic bands as well as upper bands at the center of the Brillouin zone and along the 〈100〉 directions. Acoustic scattering with proper energy relaxation, optical scattering, and intervalley scattering between equivalent and nonequivalent valleys has been taken into account. Besides drift velocities and diffusion coefficients, other quantities such as mean electron energy, electron distribution function, and valley repopulation have been obtained from the Monte Carlo simulation.},

@article{Verlinde2016,
abstract = {Recent theoretical progress indicates that spacetime and gravity emerge together from the entanglement structure of an underlying microscopic theory. These ideas are best understood in Anti-de Sitter space, where they rely on the area law for entanglement entropy. The extension to de Sitter space requires taking into account the entropy and temperature associated with the cosmological horizon. Using insights from string theory, black hole physics and quantum information theory we argue that the positive dark energy leads to a thermal volume law contribution to the entropy that overtakes the area law precisely at the cosmological horizon. Due to the competition between area and volume law entanglement the microscopic de Sitter states do not thermalise at sub-Hubble scales: they exhibit memory effects in the form of an entropy displacement caused by matter. The emergent laws of gravity contain an additional `dark' gravitational force describing the `elastic' response due to the entropy displacement. We derive an estimate of the strength of this extra force in terms of the baryonic mass, Newton's constant and the Hubble acceleration scale a{\_}0 =cH{\_}0, and provide evidence for the fact that this additional `dark gravity{\~{}}force' explains the observed phenomena in galaxies and clusters currently attributed to dark matter.},

abstract = {For a sample of 10 high-luminosity spiral galaxies, Sa through Sc, we have obtained accurate rotation curves which extend to about 80{\%} of the de Vaucouleurs radii. For this sample: (1) All rotation curves are approximately flat, to distances as great as r = 50 kpc. Secondary velocity undulations indicate rotational velocities lower by about 20 km s {\_}1 on the inner edges than on the outer edges of spiral features. (2) F max is correlated with Hubble type, and total mass M is a func-tion of both F m ax and radius. At equal radii, M(Sa) {\textgreater} M(Sc). Hence, surface mass density decreases systematically along the Hubble sequence. (3) F ma x is not correlated with luminosity or with radius. Galaxies with similar F max have radii and luminosities which differ by factors of 2 and 3. This implies a large intrinsic scatter in the Tully-Fisher relation. (4) Masses are a few times $\backslash$Q U M 0 out to the de Vaucouleurs radius, and some masses approach 10 12 M o out to the Holmberg radius. M/Lb ratios are low, near 3.5. There is a weak suggestion that M/L B is higher for early-type galaxies. While this is contrary to the accepted result of Roberts, masses for early-type galaxies are systematically low in his sample, due to an extrapolation procedure based on falling rotation curves.},

abstract = {The EDELWEISS-III direct dark matter search experiment uses cryogenic HP-Ge detectors Fully covered with Inter-Digitized electrodes (FID). They are operated at low fields ({\$}{\textless}1\backslash;\backslashmathrm{\{}V/cm{\}}{\$}), and as a consequence charge-carrier trapping significantly affects both the ionization and heat energy measurements. This paper describes an analytical model of the signals induced by trapped charges in FID detectors based on the Shockley-Ramo theorem. It is used to demonstrate that veto electrodes, initially designed for the sole purpose of surface event rejection, can be used to provide a sensitivity to the depth of the energy deposits, characterize the trapping in the crystals, perform heat and ionization energy corrections and improve the ionization baseline resolutions. These procedures are applied successfully to actual data.},

The amount of ionization produced in a detector medium is measured by the heat generated as the charged carriers are drifted across the device under an applied voltage. The amount of energy generated can be orders of magnitude larger than that deposited by the radiation itself. A dramatic increase in detector mass can be achieved compared to simple calorimetric particle detectors for equivalent energy thresholds. It is possible to obtain a sensitivity level sufficient for single‐carrier detection. The principle of operation has been demonstrated with an experimental device operated at a temperature of 1.8 K, and improved performance is expected at lower temperatures.},

abstract = {We present new weak lensing observations of 1E0657-558 (z=0.296), a unique cluster merger, that enable a direct detection of dark matter, independent of assumptions regarding the nature of the gravitational force law. Due to the collision of two clusters, the dissipationless stellar component and the fluid-like X-ray emitting plasma are spatially segregated. By using both wide-field ground based images and HST/ACS images of the cluster cores, we create gravitational lensing maps which show that the gravitational potential does not trace the plasma distribution, the dominant baryonic mass component, but rather approximately traces the distribution of galaxies. An 8-sigma significance spatial offset of the center of the total mass from the center of the baryonic mass peaks cannot be explained with an alteration of the gravitational force law, and thus proves that the majority of the matter in the system is unseen.},

abstract = {We review progress in understanding dark matter by astrophysics, and particularly via the effect of gravitational lensing. Evidence from many different directions now all imply that five sixths of the material content of the universe is in this mysterious form, separate from and beyond the ordinary "baryonic" particles in the standard model of particle physics. Dark matter appears not to interact via the electromagnetic force, and therefore neither emits nor reflects light. However, it definitely does interact via gravity, and has played the most important role in shaping the Universe on large scales. The most successful technique with which to investigate it has so far been the effect of gravitational lensing. The curvature of space-time near any gravitating mass (including dark matter) deflects passing rays of light - observably shifting, distorting and magnifying the images of background galaxies. Measurements of such effects currently provide constraints on the mean density of dark matter, and its density relative to baryonic matter; the size and mass of individual dark matter particles; and its cross section under various fundamental forces.},

@article{Markevitch2003,
abstract = {We compare new maps of the hot gas, dark matter, and galaxies for 1E0657-56, a cluster with a rare, high-velocity merger occurring nearly in the plane of the sky. The X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like gas subcluster just exiting the collision site. A prominent bow shock gives an estimate of the subcluster velocity, 4500 km/s, which lies mostly in the plane of the sky. The optical image shows that the gas lags behind the subcluster galaxies. The weak-lensing mass map reveals a dark matter clump lying ahead of the collisional gas bullet, but coincident with the effectively collisionless galaxies. From these observations, one can directly estimate the cross-section of the dark matter self-interaction. That the dark matter is not fluid-like is seen directly in the X-ray -- lensing mass overlay; more quantitative limits can be derived from three simple independent arguments. The most sensitive constraint, sigma/m{\textless}1 cm{\^{}}2/g, comes from the consistency of the subcluster mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster (and universal) value, which rules out a significant mass loss due to dark matter particle collisions. This limit excludes most of the 0.5-5 cm{\^{}}2/g interval proposed to explain the flat mass profiles in galaxies. Our result is only an order-of-magnitude estimate which involves a number of simplifying, but always conservative, assumptions; stronger constraints may be derived using hydrodynamic simulations of this cluster.},

@article{Rosenberg2010,
abstract = {In the late 20th century, cosmology became a precision science. Now, at the beginning of the next century, the parameters describing how our universe evolved from the Big Bang are generally known to a few percent. One key parameter is the total mass density of the universe. Normal matter constitutes only a small fraction of the total mass density. Observations suggest this additional mass, the dark matter, is cold (that is, moving nonrelativistically in the early universe) and interacts feebly if at all with normal matter and radiation. There's no known such elementary particle, so the strong presumption is the dark matter consists of particle relics of a new kind left over from the Big Bang. One of the most important questions in science is the nature of this dark matter. One attractive particle dark-matter candidate is the axion. The axion is a hypothetical elementary particle arising in a simple and elegant extension to the standard model of particle physics that nulls otherwise observable CP-violating effects (where CP is the product of charge reversal C and parity inversion P) in quantum chromo dynamics (QCD). A light axion of mass 10(-(6-3)) eV (the invisible axion) would couple extraordinarily weakly to normal matter and radiation and would therefore be extremely difficult to detect in the laboratory. However, such an axion is a compelling dark-matter candidate and is therefore a target of a number of searches. Compared with other particle dark-matter candidates, the plausible range of axion dark-matter couplings and masses is narrowly constrained. This focused search range allows for definitive searches, where a nonobservation would seriously impugn the dark-matter QCD-axion hypothesis. Axion searches use a wide range of technologies, and the experiment sensitivities are now reaching likely dark-matter axion couplings and masses. This article is a selective overview of the current generation of sensitive axion searches. Not all techniques and experiments are discussed, but I hope to give a sense of the current experimental landscape of the search for dark-matter axions.},

The main emphasis is on Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). A large international effort is being made to detect them directly, or else to detect their annihilation products. We explain why we consider all claims to have established a positive signal for WIMPs in either direct or indirect detection to be premature. We also introduce the concept of a {\{}$\backslash$it WIMP safe{\}} minimal mass; below this mass, the interpretation of a given direct search experiment depends strongly on the tail of the WIMP velocity distribution and/or on the experimental energy resolution.},

In the past, the leading particle candidates were cold and collisionless, and typically predicted missing energy signals at particle colliders. However, recent progress has greatly expanded the list of well-motivated candidates and the possible signatures of dark matter. This review begins with a brief summary of the standard model of particle physics and its outstanding problems. We then discuss several dark matter candidates motivated by these problems, including WIMPs, superWIMPs, light gravitinos, hidden dark matter, sterile neutrinos, and axions. For each of these, we critically examine the particle physics motivations and present their expected production mechanisms, basic properties, and implications for direct and indirect detection, particle colliders, and astrophysical observations. Upcoming experiments will discover or exclude many of these candidates, and progress may open up an era of unprecedented synergy between studies of the largest and smallest observable length scales.},

abstract = {An increasing number of experiments employ low-temperature radiation/particle detectors which are based on a calorimetric detection scheme and operate at temperatures below 100 mK. Metallic magnetic calorimeters use a metallic paramagnetic temperature sensor in tight thermal contact with the X-ray absorber. The magnetization of the sensor is used to monitor the temperature change of the detector upon the absorption of single photons, which is proportional to the absorbed energy. Low-noise high-bandwidth de superconducting quantum interference devices read out the small changes in magnetization. An energy resolution of Delta E(FWHM) = 2.7 eV was obtained for X-ray energies up to 6 keV.},

abstract = {The XENON1T experiment at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) is the first WIMP dark matter detector operating with a liquid xenon target mass above the ton-scale. Out of its 3.2t liquid xenon inventory, 2.0t constitute the active target of the dual-phase time projection chamber. The scintillation and ionization signals from particle interactions are detected with low-background photomultipliers. This article describes the XENON1T instrument and its subsystems as well as strategies to achieve an unprecedented low background level. First results on the detector response and the performance of the subsystems are also presented.},
