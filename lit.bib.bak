  Abstract                 = {An overview is given of various dark matter candidates. Among the many suggestions given in the literature, axions, inert Higgs doublet, sterile neutrinos, supersymmetric particles and Kaluza–Klein particles are discussed. The situation has recently become very interesting with new results on antimatter in the cosmic rays having dark matter as one of the leading possible explanations. Problems arising from this explanation and possible solutions are discussed, and the importance of new measurements is emphasized. If the explanation is indeed dark matter, a whole new field of physics, with unusual although not impossible mass and interaction properties, may soon open itself to discovery.},

  Abstract                 = {We present new weak-lensing observations of 1E 0657-558 ( z = 0.296), a unique cluster merger, that enable a direct detection of dark matter, independent of assumptions regarding the nature of the gravitational force law. Due to the collision of two clusters, the dissipationless stellar component and the fluid-like X-ray-emitting plasma are spatially segregated. By using both wide-field ground-based images and HST /ACS images of the cluster cores, we create gravitational lensing maps showing that the gravitational potential does not trace the plasma distribution, the dominant baryonic mass component, but rather approximately traces the distribution of galaxies. An 8 σ significance spatial offset of the center of the total mass from the center of the baryonic mass peaks cannot be explained with an alteration of the gravitational force law and thus proves that the majority of the matter in the system is unseen.},
